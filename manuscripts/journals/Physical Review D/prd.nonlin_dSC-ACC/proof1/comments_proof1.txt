Corrections to be made to the PDF proof DT11385
-----------

1)
At 3 places, there are equations which should be corrected. The errors seem to have appeared
by converting the original manuscript to XML, so that the correct equations can be found in
the manuscript I submitted. The corrections to be done:

The first 2 are to be corrected in Eq. (12a): in the first line $Acb$ should
become $A^b_{~c}$, while in the second line $Aca$ should be $A^a_{~c}$.

The third correction is to be made at the end of the sentence that begins at line
312, “Because the exterior covariant…”: In the last equation, $\omega ba$ should be
corrected for $\omega_b^{~a}$.

2)
At line 242, there appears to be too much whitespace around the inline equations. Is this normal
behavior?

3)
In Eq. (14b), in the second term of the rhs, there should be more whitespace between `cosh z’ and `F^a’. 

4)
The author affiliation needs some slight modifications, see. item 1 below.

5)
The same author Sidney R. Coleman is written in different ways in Refs. [19] and [20]. Both
references should state `S. Coleman’.

Answers to numbered items

-1-

The author affiliation should become and look exactly as:

Instituto de Física Teórica, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rua Dr. Bento Teobaldo Ferraz 271,
01140-070, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil

There should be two lines (as shown above) and the reference to which Block can be omitted.

In response to this item, the relevant sentence (line 19 to 22) can be replaced by the following:

Since the laws that govern special relativistic physics are covariant with respect to the Poincaré
group $ISO(1,3)$, i.e., the semidirect product of the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$ and the Poincaré
displacements, the corresponding spacetime is the affine Minkowski space $M$.

-3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-

Yes, the outher parantheses should be set in boldface type.

-4-

Yes, `SO’ should be set in italics.

-12, 13-

OK

-14-

Refs. [1] and [7] are still only available as e-prints; the e-print info is correct. Ref. [4] is not an e-print, and the reference in the PDF is pointing correctly to the published article.

-15-

OK

-16-

CAPES should be replaced by:

Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).

-17-

I confirm that the funding agency has been properly identified.

-18-

The references [8,9,10,16,21] are correct. There are DOI links available for:

Ref. [9] has DOI http://dx.doi.org/10.3842/SIGMA.2009.080
Ref. [10] has DOI http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9904-1893-00147-X

-19-

The links are directing to the correct references.

-20-

OK, the change from ‘5’ to ’05’ is correct.

Reviewer #1: The paper "Dark energy as a kinematic effect" by 
H. Jennen, J. G. Pereira discusses  a cosmological model derived from  teleparallel gravity  and consistent to  the de Sitter
group SO(1; 4). The authors consider  a nonlinear Riemann-Cartan geometry
without curvature that  naturally gives rise to an effective  nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theory of gravity.  The model   contains  a kinematical  contribution that could be interpreted in view of Dark Energy. The approach is interesting and correct in the framework of teleparallel-gravity.  However, the authors should improve the final discussion  in view of possible physical applications of the model. For example, a qualitative discussion towards cosmography and observations would be useful for the reader in order to realize a dark energy behavior (see e.g. Class.Quant.Grav. 28 (2011) 215011, Phys.Rev. D91 (2015) 12, 124037, JCAP 1412 (2014) 12, 021, Astrophys.Space Sci. 342 (2012) 155-228,  Phys.Rev. D88 (2013) 103526).

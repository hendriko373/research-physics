Dear Editor:

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, entitled "Dark energy as a kinematic
effect," for consideration for publication in Physics of the Dark Universe.

The article aims at constructing a theory for gravity with a nonconstant
cosmological function, which modifies the local kinematics of physics, now
governed by the de Sitter group SO(1,4). To this purpose, we employ de
Sitter-Cartan geometry with a cosmological function. Most importantly, it
is shown that the cosmological function gives rise to a kinematic contribution
in the relative acceleration between particles freely falling in a
gravitational field.

We believe the article is of interest to the readers of Physics of the Dark
Universe, since it implements a model in which dark energy, while having its
own dynamics coupled to the gravitational field, reveals itself as a kinematic
effect.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration of
publication elsewhere.

Yours sincerely,

Hendrik Jennen on behalf of the authors

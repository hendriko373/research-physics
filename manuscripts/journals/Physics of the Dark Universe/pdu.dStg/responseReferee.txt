I would like to thank the Referee for the thorough reading of the manuscript and the helpful comments.

I agree with the Referee’s observation that “a qualitative discussion towards cosmography and observations would be useful for the reader in order to realize  a dark energy behavior,” and we have extended the text in the Conclusions (see the last three paragraphs of Conclusions).

A quantitative discussion towards cosmography will be necessary to verify the model proposed for the dynamics of the gravitational field and cosmological function, and it is work in progress to solve the field equations in order to be able to do so.

With kindest regards,

Hendrik Jennen on behalf of the authors

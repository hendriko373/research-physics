@article{Behrndt:fk,
	Abstract = {Based on recent proposals linking four and five-dimensional BPS solutions, we discuss the explicit dictionary between general stationary 4D and 5D supersymmetric solutions in N=2 supergravity theories with cubic prepotentials. All these solutions are completely determined in terms of the same set of harmonic functions and the same set of attractor equations. As an example, we discuss black holes and black rings in G\"odel-Taub-NUT spacetime. Then we consider corrections to the 4D solutions associated with more general prepotentials and comment on analogous corrections on the 5D side.},

@article{Tripathy:fk,
	Abstract = {We find examples of non-supersymmetric attractors in Type II string theory compactified on a Calabi Yau three-fold. For a non-supersymmetric attractor the fixed values to which the moduli are drawn at the horizon must minimise an effective potential. For Type IIA at large volume, we consider a configuration carrying D0, D2, D4 and D6 brane charge. When the D6 brane charge is zero, we find for some range of the other charges, that a non-supersymmetric attractor solution exists. When the D6 brane charge is non-zero, we find for some range of charges, a supersymmetry breaking extremum of the effective potential. Closer examination reveals though that it is not a minimum of the effective potential and hence the corresponding black hole solution is not an attractor. Away from large volume, we consider the specific case of the quintic in CP^4. Working in the mirror IIB description we find non-supersymmetric attractors near the Gepner point.},

@article{Ferrara:fk,
	Abstract = {We study the stabilization of scalars near a supersymmetric black hole horizon using the equation of motion of a particle moving in a potential and background metric. When the relevant 4-dimensional theory is described by special geometry, the generic properties of the critical points of this potential can be studied. We find that the extremal value of the central charge provides the minimal value of the BPS mass and of the potential under the condition that the moduli space metric is positive at the critical point. We relate these ideas to the Weinhold and Ruppeiner metrics introduced in the geometric approach to thermodynamics and used for study of critical phenomena.},

@article{Kallosh:uq,
	Abstract = {We study the attractor mechanism for extremal non-BPS black holes with an infinite throat near horizon geometry, developing, as we do so, a physical argument as to why such a mechanism does not exist in non-extremal cases. We present a detailed derivation of the non-supersymmetric attractor equation. This equation defines the stabilization of moduli near the black hole horizon: the fixed moduli take values specified by electric and magnetic charges corresponding to the fluxes in a Calabi Yau compactification of string theory. They also define the so-called double-extremal solutions. In some examples, studied previously by Tripathy and Trivedi, we solve the equation and show that the moduli are fixed at values which may also be derived from the critical points of the black hole potential.},

@article{Goldstein:fk,
	Abstract = {We consider theories with gravity, gauge fields and scalars in four-dimensional asymptotically flat space-time. By studying the equations of motion directly we show that the attractor mechanism can work for non-supersymmetric extremal black holes. Two conditions are sufficient for this, they are conveniently stated in terms of an effective potential involving the scalars and the charges carried by the black hole. Our analysis applies to black holes in theories with ${\cal N} \le 1$ supersymmetry, as well as non-supersymmetric black holes in theories with ${\cal N} = 2$ supersymmetry. Similar results are also obtained for extremal black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space and in higher dimensions.},

We discuss the generalization to other groups and comment on an apparent paradox: why are the `RR charges' of these branes not quantized?},

@article{Pioline:uq,
	Abstract = {In these lecture notes, we review some recent developments on the relation between the macroscopic entropy of four-dimensional BPS black holes and the microscopic counting of states, beyond the thermodynamical, large charge limit. After a brief overview of charged black holes in supergravity and string theory, we give an extensive introduction to special and very special geometry, attractor flows and topological string theory, including holomorphic anomalies. We then expose the Ooguri-Strominger-Vafa (OSV) conjecture which relates microscopic degeneracies to the topological string amplitude, and review precision tests of this formula on ``small'' black holes. Finally, motivated by a holographic interpretation of the OSV conjecture, we give a systematic approach to the radial quantization of BPS black holes (i.e. quantum attractors). This suggests the existence of a one-parameter generalization of the topological string amplitude, and provides a general framework for constructing automorphic partition functions for black hole degeneracies in theories with sufficient degree of symmetry.},

These objects are solutions to the effective action obtained from M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold, including the one-loop corrections determined by anomaly cancellation and supersymmetry. We introduce the off-shell formulation of this theory obtained through the conformal supergravity method and review the methods for investigating supersymmetric solutions. This leads to quantum/string corrected attractor geometries, as well as asymptotically flat black strings and spinning black holes. With these solutions in hand, we compare our results with analogous studies in four-dimensional string-corrected supergravity, emphasizing the distinctions between the four and five dimensional theories.},

We also describe precise computation of the microscopic degeneracy of a class of quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric string theories, and compare the statistical entropy of these dyons, expanded in inverse powers of electric and magnetic charges, with a similar expansion of the corresponding black hole entropy. This comparison is extended to include the contribution to the entropy from multi-centered black holes as well.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that extremal magnetic black hole solutions of N = 2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets $X^\Lambda$ with a generic holomorphic prepotential $F(X^\Lambda)$ can be described as supersymmetric solitons which interpolate between maximally symmetric limiting solutions at spatial infinity and the horizon. A simple exact solution is found for the special case that the ratios of the $X^\Lambda$ are real, and it is seen that the logarithm of the conformal factor of the spatial metric equals the Kahler potential on the vector multiplet moduli space. Several examples are discussed in detail.},
